Hello, welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Simone Vuotto, and this is where I share my thoughts and reflections on my experiences and the topics that interest me most. I'll try share my thoughts about software engineering, diving into the world of AI, reflecting on recent events, and exploring what's happening around the globe. This blog is a space for me to document my journey of learning and growth.
